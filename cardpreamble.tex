%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%  Set up trimmed page and stock page so that trim size works with pgftikz
%  Use \calculatetrims when you change page geometry
%  You also have to use "trimmed page" or "stock page" instead of "current page" in tikz
%  This is general enough to work with different trim sizes and different margins etc on recto and verso pages
%  Thanks to tex.stackexchange.com for this solution
