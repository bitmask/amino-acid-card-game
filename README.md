Translation: The Amino Acid Card Game

This is a deck building card game.  During the game, you will spend action
points to create a deck of powerful mutations, which you will apply to
translate amino acids from a nucleotide sequence.  The more amino acids of the
same group that you collect, the higher your score will become.

This game does not require any knowledge of biology to play.  In fact, it is
designed to sneak information about the amino acids and their properties into
game play, and to help you learn and remember them as you play.
